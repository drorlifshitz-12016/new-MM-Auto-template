# MISHMASH Robot Template

so this template dose not use normal FTC lib it uses a custom 
off the shelf version from the FTC team MISHMASH #12016
called MM lib 

so this project can be configured in the normal FTC manner 
or if you want to take the time and learn MMlib
you can check the documentation for stuff like IMU or different Op-mode commands
by clicking - CTRL + CLICK

# and or you can just not read this and just troubleshoot yourself #


this robot template uses the GOBildaPinPoint odometry computer for the IMU 

the product page - 
https://www.gobilda.com/pinpoint-odometry-computer-imu-sensor-fusion-for-2-wheel-odometry/

BE AWARE THAT I AM USING THE SWINGARM POD FOR THIS TEMPLATE SO I WOULD ALSO HAVE A 
DIFFERENT BRANCH FOR 4 BAR ODOMETRY 

but the idea behind this is that the user (you) still would have the full FTC RR 
experience but with no of the buffer of making adjustments for road runner and for
a undisturbed tuning process 

and credit to J5155 from team #12087 for doing most of the work 

ENJOY !!
